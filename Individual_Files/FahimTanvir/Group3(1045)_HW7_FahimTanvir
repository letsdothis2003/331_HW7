I used  DENSE_RANK as it is crucial when rank equality matters, ensuring that 
            sales reports are consistent and do not skip ranks due to ties.*/

id so we get each customer's transactions from earliest within our
directory to latest with their recent transactions being inputted first.
This is just to be more organized based on tracking out customer metrics*/
