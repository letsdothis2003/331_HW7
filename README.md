Goal and Motivation:
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is hw 7 for CSCI 331. We provided every file we worked on, separated per person except the GANTT chart and
TODO list(IN TIME_MANAGEMENT, which every member each adhered to. Our leader, Esfar, helped with direction
(using the chart and list along with frequent communication). HW7 discussed windows functions and paging, which are methods
to get us to organize our data a lot better as it helps pare down what the user is looking for. 

We separated each tasks into pairs:
PAIR 1(ESFAR AND YOUSUF)

PAIR 2(SAYANTAN AND FAHIM):

And Justin did the project solo.

For the pairs, we solved each mystery our partner produced and collaborated using video call and SQL tools(Azure Data Studio, SQL Management Studio and Dbeaver) to create 3-4 queries to solve each one. 

For walkthroughs, we uploaded each on youtube:
